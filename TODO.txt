Short Term
----------

Use Component.findChildAt() to locate active.

Keep offset from obj origin so can move at any point
(avoid jerk when start move)

Use Swing Actions throughout the View/Controller - mostly done.

Longer Term
-----------
Split into model and swingui packages.

Load and save in SVG. Filename chooser.

Add "create()" method for interactive creation of objects.

Add "resize()".

Add Properties editor for GObjects.

When you have all that done, it's no longer just a toy,
but a real demo program.
