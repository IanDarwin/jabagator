Short Term
----------
Use Component.findChildAt() to locate active.

Keep offset from obj origin so can move at any point
(avoid jerk when start move)

Use Swing Actions throughout the JavaSE View/Controller - mostly done.

Longer Term
-----------
Use Lists more: selection, for example.

Load and save in ODF and/or SVG.

Filename chooser.

Add "create()" method for interactive creation of objects.

Add "resize()".

Add Properties editor for GObjects.

When you have all that done, it's no longer just a toy,
but a real demo program.
